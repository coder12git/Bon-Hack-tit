## What it does
Our web application is designed to make meal planning more convenient and efficient for busy individuals. With three key features, users can easily create a weekly menu based on their dietary needs and preferences, generate recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand, and try something new with exciting recipe ideas.

The first feature, 
- **Create your weekly menu**: Allows users to customize their meal plan by inputting their diet details, target calories, preferred cuisines, and ingredients they want to include or exclude from recipes. This feature takes the stress out of meal planning by providing users with recipe ideas that meet their nutritional needs and taste preferences. 

The second feature, 
- **What's in your fridge**: Allows users to make the most of the ingredients they already have at home. By inputting the ingredients they have on hand and the number of recipes they want to generate, users can easily access a variety of recipe ideas to inspire their meals and reduce food waste.

The third feature,
- **Try something new today**: It is perfect for users looking to add some variety to their meal rotation. By selecting tags and the number of recipes they want, users can explore new recipes and expand their culinary horizons.

Additionally, we wanted to provide users with **a convenient way to access their meal plans and recipes without having to constantly log into our web application**. That's why we added a feature that allows users to **download their menus and recipe lists in a PDF file**. This way, users can easily access their meal plans and recipes offline, and even print them out if needed. We believe that this feature adds a lot of value to our application, making it even more convenient and user-friendly for busy people who are always on the go.

Overall, our web application provides a user-friendly and efficient solution for meal planning, recipe generation, and nutrient tracking to help busy individuals make healthier and more delicious meals every day.


## How it works
To use **FoodMeets**, start by navigating to the home page and selecting one of the three features available. For example, if you want to plan out your weekly menu, select the "Create Your Weekly Menu" feature. Next, enter details such as your dietary preferences, target calories, cuisine preferences, and any ingredients you want to include or exclude from your recipes. Once you've entered all the necessary information, click the submit button.

You will then be taken to a page where you can see your weekly menus. Click on any of the meals to see the complete recipe for that meal, including ingredients and instructions on how to prepare it. If you want to save the recipe for later, simply click on the download button to download the recipe as a .pdf file.

Similarly, you can use the other two features of FoodMeets, "What's In Your Fridge" and "Try Something New Today," by following the same process of entering the necessary details and clicking the submit button.
